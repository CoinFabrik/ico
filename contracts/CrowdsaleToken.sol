 * - The token contract gives an opt-in upgrade path to a new contract
 * - The same token can be part of several crowdsales through the approve() mechanism
 * - The token can be capped (supply set in the constructor) or uncapped (crowdsale contract can mint new tokens)
 * - ERC20 tokens transferred to this contract can be recovered by a lost and found master
